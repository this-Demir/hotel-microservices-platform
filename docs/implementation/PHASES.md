- [x] `src/client/Dockerfile` + `src/admin-client/Dockerfile` created
- [x] `launchSettings.json` ports fixed across all services (avoid Windows Hyper-V exclusions)
- [x] `ocelot.json` ports updated to match launchSettings (7000–7004 range)
- [x] Redis connection string switched from `rediss://` URL to StackExchange.Redis native format
- [x] Supabase direct host replaced with session pooler (`aws-1-ap-northeast-1.pooler.supabase.com`)

### 6b — Cloud Deployment (Done — Azure Container Apps)

Platform switched from Google Cloud Run → **Azure Container Apps** (Consumption plan, Germany West Central).

- [x] Create Azure resource group `rg-hotelbooking-prod` + Container Apps Environment `cae-hotelbooking`
- [x] Set up OIDC federation (no stored credentials) — service principal `5403a930-d7a2-4c0c-a3d4-3a27b57c9699`
- [x] Set GitHub secrets: `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
- [x] Push Docker images to GHCR (private); ACA pulls via registry credential (PAT `read:packages`)
- [x] Deploy all 5 services to ACA — api-gateway public, 4 services internal-only
- [x] Create `ocelot.Production.json` with ACA internal FQDNs (`*.internal.ashycoast-db26d23e.germanywestcentral.azurecontainerapps.io`)
- [x] Set all runtime secrets in ACA secret store (`secretref:`) — never in git or GitHub secrets
- [x] Wire `az containerapp update --image` deploy step into all 5 GitHub Actions workflows
- [x] End-to-end verified: `GET /health` → 200, `GET /api/v1/search` → real Supabase data

---

## Phase 7 — Frontends

### client (user-facing)
- [x] Sign in / sign up pages — mock auth (Cognito wiring deferred to Phase 6)
- [x] Search page — destination, dates, guest count with `+/-` guest control
- [x] Search results — horizontal hotel cards, sidebar filters (price, stars, property type)
- [x] Member discount — 15% applied in search results and booking modal when signed in
- [x] "Show on Map" feature — hotel pins on placeholder map with hover tooltips
- [x] Hotel detail page — hero image, two-column layout, rooms tab, reviews tab with category bars
- [x] Booking flow — modal with hero image, date summary, itemised price breakdown, confirmation toast
- [x] AI chat window — floating widget, indigo gradient header, bouncing-dot thinking indicator
- [x] In-app notifications panel — right-slide drawer, unread badge, mark-all-as-read
- [x] Transparent header on landing, solid on scroll; numeric unread badge
- [x] Full landing page — hero, featured cities grid, value-props section, footer
- [x] Frontend redesigned to match CLAUDE-DESIGN spec (`/CLAUDE-DESIGN/design_handoff_stayease`)

## Phase 9 — Lambda, Notification E2E, Bug Fixes (2026-05-18)

### 9a — Lambda + EventBridge
- [x] Fix `aws-lambda-tools-defaults.json` runtime: `dotnet9` → `dotnet10` (AWS Lambda skips .NET 9)
- [x] Upgrade `cron-jobs` target framework `net9.0` → `net10.0`; update CI workflow
- [x] Create IAM execution role `lambda-capacity-checker-role` (AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole)
- [x] Deploy `CapacityCheckerFunction` via `dotnet lambda deploy-function` — us-east-1, 512MB, 60s
- [x] Set Lambda env vars: `SUPABASE_CONNECTION_STRING`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `NOTIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL`
- [x] Create EventBridge rule `nightly-capacity-check` — `cron(0 1 * * ? *)`
- [x] Wire Lambda as target + grant `lambda:InvokeFunction` permission
- [x] Manual test invoke — "0 alert(s) sent", 2168ms, CloudWatch logs verified
- [x] Set GitHub secrets: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `LAMBDA_EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN`

### 9b — Notification E2E + Bug Fixes
- [x] **BUG FIX:** Queue name mismatch — `notification-service` listened on `booking.events`, hotel-service published to `booking-events`
- [x] **BUG FIX:** JWT `sub` claim remapping — added `MapInboundClaims = false` to `AddJwtBearer` in hotel-service + comments-service
- [x] **BUG FIX:** Consumer crash loop on email failure — isolated email try-catch so in-app notification always writes
- [x] **BUG FIX:** Access token sent instead of ID token — `auth-context.tsx` `setToken(accessToken)` → `setToken(idToken)` (access token has no `email` claim)
- [x] Set `notification-service --min-replicas 1` (background RabbitMQ worker cannot scale to zero)
- [x] End-to-end verified: book → RabbitMQ → Resend email (200) + Supabase Notifications row written + in-app panel shows notification

---

## Phase 10 — Admin Panel + Notification Flow (2026-05-20)

### 10a — Bug Fixes
- [x] **BUG-005 FIXED** — `DELETE /hotels/{id}` with rooms returned 500; now returns 409 with guard check
- [x] **BUG-006 FIXED** — Admin image upload returned 500; fixed in earlier session (Supabase bucket created, error body surfaced)
- [x] **BUG-007 FIXED** — Lambda was inserting `UserId = AdminEmail`; fix: added `AdminSub` (nullable text) to `Hotels` + EF migration `AddHotelAdminSub` applied to Supabase; `HotelModal.tsx` auto-fills from JWT `sub` on create/edit; `Function.cs` now uses `AdminSub ?? ""` as `UserId`
- [x] **Notification mark-read broken** — `[HttpPatch]` → `[HttpPut]` in `NotificationsController`; both clients already sent `PUT`; Ocelot only allowed `GET,PUT`
- [x] **No bare notification GET route** — added explicit `GET /api/v1/notifications` to both `ocelot.json` and `ocelot.Production.json` (mirrors search dual-route pattern)

### 10b — Admin Panel
- [x] `GET /api/v1/admin/reservations` — new endpoint returns all reservations paginated; routed through existing `/api/v1/admin/{everything}` GET rule (no Ocelot change)
- [x] `AdminSub` exposed in `auth-context.tsx` (parsed from Cognito Access Token `sub` claim)
- [x] `HotelModal.tsx` sends `adminSub` on create; preserves existing `adminSub` on edit
- [x] `AdminNotificationsPanel.tsx` — new slide-out drawer (amber alert theme), mark-read, relative timestamps
- [x] `AdminShell.tsx` — top bar with bell icon + numeric unread badge; Dashboard / Hotels / Reservations nav items; fetches notifications on mount
- [x] `app/reservations/page.tsx` — paginated table: hotel, room type, check-in/out, guests, price, derived status (Upcoming/Active/Completed from dates)
- [x] `app/page.tsx` — dashboard with stat cards (total hotels, total bookings) + recent 5 bookings table

---

## Phase 11 — Remaining Work

### 11a — Data Reset (Planned)
- [x] **Wipe Supabase** — clear all rows from Hotels, Rooms, RoomAvailabilities, Reservations, Notifications, HotelImages (schema stays)
- [x] **Reseed** — create 10–20 hotels via admin panel (each auto-fills `AdminSub`; set `AdminEmail` to the Resend account email)
- [x] **Lambda E2E verify** — manual invoke after seed; confirm notification row has `UserId = <admin sub>` → appears in admin notifications panel

### 11b — AI Agent (Course Requirement)
- [x] **End-to-end wired** — `ChatWidget.tsx` handles `search_hotels` + `book_hotel` tool responses; agent calls hotel-service with user JWT
- [x] **Error handling** — graceful inline error message when `chatWithAgent()` throws
- [x] **UI polish** — `thinking` loading indicator (bouncing dots) while waiting for OpenAI response
- [x] **Search guard** — `AiAgentService.cs` enforces search before fetching reviews (`fix: AI must search before fetching reviews`)

### 11c — User Client Features
- [x] My Bookings page — `app/bookings/page.tsx` — hotel name, dates, price, status badge
- [x] My Account page — `app/account/page.tsx` — profile from Cognito ID token claims
- [x] Show on Map — **course requirement met** — split-view with interactive Leaflet pins (`InteractiveMap.tsx`), `HotelCardCompact.tsx` for map view; `HotelMap.tsx` for detail page
- [x] Member discount badge — show original + discounted price in search results when signed in
- [ ] Error toasts + loading states + skeleton screens across all flows

### 11d — Final Deliverables
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` — remove obsolete `version: "3.9"` line
- [ ] Full end-to-end smoke test (all flows)
- [ ] `README.md` — live URLs, architecture diagram, ER diagrams, assumptions, known issues
- [ ] 5-minute demo video recorded and linked
